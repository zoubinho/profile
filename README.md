## 📈 What Makes My Work Different

**1. Domain-Driven Design**  
Every system is built around actual financial workflows, not generic AI demos. I understand PM/analyst pain points because I've worked in financial data infrastructure for years.

**2. Production Quality from Day One**  
My projects include error handling, monitoring, audit trails, and cost optimization. They're designed to be deployed, not just prototyped.

**3. Measurable Business Impact**  
All projects have clear KPIs: time savings, accuracy improvements, adoption metrics. I build to solve problems, not to showcase technology.

**4. Cost-Conscious Architecture**  
Self-hosted where it makes sense, leveraging open-source tools. My Portfolio Intelligence System costs $10/month vs $500+ for SaaS alternatives.

**💡 Why I'm pivoting to buy-side AI:**

I spent years building data infrastructure at market data vendors. I know the tooling, the workflows, the pain points. Now I'm applying modern AI capabilities to solve the problems I watched portfolio managers and analysts struggle with daily.

The future belongs to firms that augment human judgment with intelligent systems—not replace it, but systematically enhance it. That's what I build.
